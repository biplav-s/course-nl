        properly made if made on the basis of being pro rata among

            (2) Election not to have section apply.--This section shall 
        not apply with respect to any employer for any calendar quarter 
        if such employer elects (at such time and in such manner as the 
        Secretary of the Treasury (or the Secretary's delegate) may 
        prescribe) not to have this section apply.
            (3) Certain terms.--Any term used in this section which is

        The Secretary of the Treasury (or the Secretary's delegate) 
        shall pay to each possession of the United States which has a 
        mirror code tax system amounts equal to the loss (if any) to 
        that possession by reason of the application of the provisions 
        of this section. Such amounts shall be determined by the 
        Secretary of the Treasury (or the Secretary's delegate) based on 
        information provided by the government of the respective 
        possession.
            (2) Payments to other possessions.--The Secretary of the 
        Treasury (or the Secretary's delegate) shall pay to each 
        possession of the United States which does not have a mirror 
        code tax system amounts estimated by the Secretary of the 
        Treasury (or the Secretary's delegate) as being equal to the 
        aggregate benefits (if any) that would have been provided to 
        residents of such possession by reason of the provisions of this 
        section if a mirror code tax system had been in effect in such 
        possession. The preceding sentence shall not apply unless the 
        respective possession has a plan, which has been approved by the 
        Secretary of the Treasury (or the Secretary's delegate), under 
        which such possession will promptly distribute such payments to 
        its residents.
            (3) <<NOTE: Definition.>>  Mirror code tax system.--For 
        purposes of this section, the term ``mirror code tax system'' 
        means, with respect to any possession of the United States, the 
        income tax system of such possession if the income tax liability 
        of the residents of such possession under such system is 
        determined by reference to the income tax laws of the United 
        States as if such possession were the United States.
            (4) Treatment of payments.--For purposes of section 1324 of 
        title 31, United States Code, the payments under this section 
        shall be treated in the same manner as a refund due from a 
        credit provision referred to in subsection (b)(2) of such 
        section.

        of the purposes of this Act, and
